# Instructions

The current R project directory contains all files needed to complete the tidy data project related to Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data*. Following files must be present:

* *README.md* : This file
* *CodeBook.md* : User guide explaining the data processing performed on the raw dataset
* *run_analysis.R* : R Script performing the complete data processing

It is recommended to read file *CodeBook.md* first before executing the R script.The original data set is not provided in this project directory. The user is invited to download the whole dataset at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. The R script assumes that the whole dataset was unpacked under directory **dataset** located in the project current directory. There are instructions the code book to help the user to alter the location of the dataset (scenario not tested).

The complete data processing can be run by just sourcing R script *run_analysis.R* in the current RStudio session.
